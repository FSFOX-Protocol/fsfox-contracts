## ⚠️ Problem: STF Error in Presale Mode

### Cause of Problem:

In Presale mode (`tradingEnabled = false`):
- ✅ **Buying from Pool allowed:** Pool → User (FSFOX)
- ❌ **Selling to Pool NOT allowed:** User → Pool (PAXG)

**In PAXG → FSFOX Swap:**
- User → Pool (PAXG): This is considered a **PAXG Sale** ❌
- Pool → User (FSFOX): This is an **FSFOX Buy** ✅

**Result:** SwapRouter cannot take PAXG from User because it's considered a sale.

---

## ✅ Solutions

### Solution 1: Use QuickSwap UI (Recommended)

QuickSwap might use a different method or bypass Presale limits:

1. Go to https://quickswap.exchange/swap
2. Swap PAXG to FSFOX
3. Connect MetaMask
4. Execute Swap

---

### Solution 2: Enable Full Trading

If you want users to be able to Swap with PAXG too:

**From Gnosis Safe:**
1. **To:** `0xe5C72a59981d3c19a74DC6144e13f6b244ee5e2B` (FSFOX)
2. **Function:** `enableTrading()`
3. **Submit** → Sign → **Execute**

**After `enableTrading()`:**
- ✅ Users can buy with USDC
- ✅ Users can buy with PAXG
- ✅ Users can sell

---

### Solution 3: Use USDC Pool

If you want to buy FSFOX:

1. **Swap PAXG to USDC** (on QuickSwap or Uniswap)
2. **Buy FSFOX with USDC** (from FSFOX/USDC Pool)

**Script for Buying with USDC:**
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/buyFSFOX.js --network polygon
```
